# frida-stack

Small frida module for ensuring you get the stack information you wanted.

## What?

Often when using [Frida](https://github.com/frida/frida), I would run into issues
with wanting specific stack traces. Then I realized I didn't have a specific context
window, or the stack traces didn't contain the correct shared libraries in them. This
resulted in me re-writing the same functions all the time.

In other instances, mostly when reverse engineering heavily obfuscated or packed code,
I would have discovered functions or places in memory which had been created without any
exports available. This would lead to questions like, what process/library owned this? Where
am I inside those libraries?

To answer the above questions, I wrapped some of the standard `Thread.Backtrace` functions
and added some scanning of the `Process` memory ranges.

## Installing

```sh
$ npm install frida-stack
```

## Usage

```typescript

import { Stack } from 'frida-stack'

function hook_exit() {
  const _exitPtr = Process.findModuleByName("libc.so")?.findExportByName("_exit");

  if (_exitPtr) {
    const _exit = new NativeFunction(_exitPtr, 'int', ['int']);

    Interceptor.replace(
      _exitPtr,
      new NativeCallback(
        function (status) {
          console.log(`[+] _exit : ${status} from ${Stack.getModuleInfo(this.context.pc)}`);
	        console.log(Stack.native(this.context)
          return _exit(status);
        },
        'int',
        ['int'],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Output:
```
[Pixel 4::com.example.package ]-> [+] _exit : 0 from 0x7713d25000 libexamplesharedlib.so:0x1aae8
0x7713d25000 libexamplesharedlib.so:0x1aae8
```

Now you have a library and the exact offset into the library for reversing.
